- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakeitaylor
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development (PHP/SQL/JS/MongoDB)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a brand new guild management system using the Hypixel API and Laravel.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord: exkay#0834.

I have several projects such as web apps using API's and databases and have repositories for my coursework during my BSc and MSc degrees. My main project is currently a web app for tracking player data from the Hypixel Minecraft Network. This website (https://ayeballers.xyz) contains player statistics, leaderboards and guild management. Using multiple API's and MySQL/MongoDB, this website has over 2000 unique monthly views and 150,000 total player lookups.

I have recently worked with a non-profit organisation to develop a system capable of monitoring intruders in cargo spaces. This system can be used to prevent human trafficking and makes use of Raspberry Pi hardware, Python, PHP and MySQL.
