I have several projects such as web apps using API's and databases and have repositories for my coursework during my BSc and MSc degrees. My main project is currently a web app for tracking player data from the Hypixel Minecraft Network. This website (https://ayeballers.xyz) contains player statistics, leaderboards and guild management. Using multiple API's and MySQL/MongoDB, this website has over 2000 unique monthly views and 100,000 player lookups.
