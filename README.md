- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakeitaylor
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development (PHP/SQL/JS/MongoDB)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my final year Masters project in Python, PHP and SQL.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord: exkay#0184

I have several projects such as web apps using API's and databases and have repositories for my coursework during my BSc and MSc degrees. My main project is currently a web app for tracking player data from the Hypixel Minecraft Network. This website (https://ayeballers.xyz) contains player statistics, leaderboards and guild management. Using multiple API's and MySQL/MongoDB, this website has over 2000 unique monthly views and 100,000 player lookups.

In the near future, I am hoping to learn Laravel to upgrade existing sites and learn how to move away from traditional PHP development to using frameworks used in the real world.
